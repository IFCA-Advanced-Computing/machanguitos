@section intr_sec Introduction
The Easiest <b>Multi-Agent System</b> in the world.

Work done at The Institute of Physics of Cantabria (<a href="http://www.ifca.es">IFCA</a>).

@section inst_sec Install
@subsection inst_pre_ssec Prerequisites

You need the next libraries installed: Boost, MPI and GDAL

Also it is needed a Mongo database to output agents values during execution.

@subsection inst_com_ssec Compile

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=[install_path] ..
    make
    [sudo] make install

@subsection inst_test_ssec Fire Example

@image html fire.gif "Fire simulation output"

Fire Example is a unrealistic example of what can be done with
Machanguitos. Fire simulate a 2D fire demo using agents as Fire spots and a
image that is update to simulate the fire smoke.

The main file is in charge of create the fire spots and a 2d image to be
updated:

@include ex03.lua

This simulation as presented always generate the same output. To make variations
you should set a different randomseed on 'config.setvars'.

The fire agents initialized themselves on a random position at the bottom of the
2D area. Then during the simulation they move linearly at the bottom generating
heat (writing 255 on the layer):

@include fire.lua

The Fire layer simulates the smoke with a sort-of average of neighbors pixels:

@include fireupdate.lua
